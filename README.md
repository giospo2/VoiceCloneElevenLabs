# How I Earned $200 in Passive Income Using Eleven Labs  

This month, I earned **$200 in fully passive income** using Eleven Labs, and I want to share exactly how I did it. While I’ve seen others explain the process, I noticed their guides often miss key details, like the specific steps to set up payouts and how to activate monetization. That’s why I created this **comprehensive guide** to give you everything you need to start monetizing your voice efficiently.

## How to Monetize Your Voice on Eleven Labs  

### 1. Create an Account  
Sign up for an account on the [Eleven Labs website](https://try.elevenlabs.io/3rajzr8mfck9) For monetization, you’ll need the **Creator Plan**, which costs $22. However, with a **50% discount link** ([Sign up now](https://try.elevenlabs.io/3rajzr8mfck9)), the cost drops to $11.  

After purchasing the Creator Plan, navigate to the **"Voices" menu**.

Select **"Professional Voice Clone"**.

Upload a high-quality audio sample (minimum 30 minutes; 3 hours recommended for best results).  

> **Pro Tip**: Ensure the audio is clear and free of background noise. I used my studio for this, but a friend of mine used an iPhone mic, reading 30 minutes a day from a self-awareness book over three days.

### 2. Set Up Voice Actor Payouts  
This step is often overlooked in other guides. After creating your voice clone:  

1. Complete a **Voice Captcha** to verify your identity.  
2. Once verified, your voice will appear in your **Voice Library** under the "Voices" menu.  
3. Click **"View"** on your voice to open its dashboard.  
4. Scroll down and click the **red button** labeled for sharing and discovery.

On the next page:  
- Enable **"Shared Voice"** and **"Discovery in Voice Library"**.

- Wait 1–2 days for approval.  

Once approved, you’ll earn money whenever your voice is used.

### 3. Configure Payment Options  
To receive payouts:  

1. Go to the **Payouts** section in your Eleven Labs dashboard.  
2. Set up a **Stripe Connect** account by following the prompts.  
3. Payouts are processed weekly if your earnings exceed $10.

### 4. Use Your Voice for Content Creation  
In addition to earning passive income, you can use your cloned voice to create content for:  
- YouTube videos  
- TikTok and Instagram reels  
- Audiobooks  
- Podcasts, and more  

With the **100,000 characters included** in the Creator Plan, you have plenty of resources to generate engaging content and monetize it further.

### Proof

This isn’t just passive income—it’s also a tool for creating high-quality content. I’ve used my credits this month to create videos, audiobooks, and other projects while earning $200 passively.
